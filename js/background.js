There are two related but distinct capabilities needed to supervise a robotic swarm The first is comprehension of the swarm 's state and the second is prediction of the effects of human inputs on the swarm 's behavior . Both of them are very challenging . Prior work in the literature has shown that inserting the human input as soon as possible to divert the swarm from its original goal towards the new goal does not always result in optimal performance ( measured by some criterion such as the total time required by the swarm to reach the second goal ) . This phenomenon has been called Neglect Benevolence , conveying the idea that in many cases it is preferable to neglect the swarm for some time before inserting human input ."

In order to approximate equilibrium strategies in these games , the leading approach is to create a sufficiently small strategic approximation of the full game , called an abstraction , and to solve that smaller game instead . The leading abstraction algorithm for imperfect-information games generates abstractions that have imperfect recall and are distribution aware , using k-means with the earth mover 's distance metric to cluster similar states together . A distribution-aware abstraction groups states together at a given round if their full distributions over future strength are similar ( as opposed to , for example , just the expectation of their strength ) .

We previously developed a tumor phylogeny inference pipeline for array comparative genome hybridization ( aCGH ) -based tumor copy number profiles . Steps in the pipeline included extraction of robust progression markers from the data , which could differentiate stages of tumor evolution or the different paths in the tree , and assigning amplification states to the inferred markers in those stages We introduced a novel multi-sample model for amplicon identification and calling , HMMCNA , which jointly extracted markers from and assigned amplification states to small sets of tumor aCGH profiles . HMMCNA employs a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) , a probabilistic model , to classify data into normal and amplified states based on an underlying distribution for the two copy number states and a hidden state space of possible amplification states We assumed two possible amplification states per sample : normal ( 0 ) or amplified ( 1 ) . Joint segmentation and calling is performed by identifying a most likely sequence of amplification states across all genomic sites probes and samples . Further steps include tuning the parameters of the HMM to handle noise-levels across different datasets . Citation Format : Ayshwarya Subramanian , Stanley Shackney , Russell Schwartz .

This is due to the fact that tasks can access data in the same cache set shared among processor cores or in the same memory bank in the DRAM memory ( or both ) . Such cache and bank interference effects have motivated the need to create isolation mechanisms for resources accessed by more than one One popular isolation mechanism is cache coloring that divides the cache into multiple partitions . With cache coloring , each task can be assigned exclusive cache partitions , thereby preventing cache interference from other tasks . Similarly , bank coloring allows assigning exclusive bank partitions to tasks . While cache coloring and some bank coloring mechanisms have been studied separately , interactions between the two schemes have not been studied . Specifically , while memory accesses to two different bank colors do not interfere with each other at the bank level , they may interact at the cache level . Similarly , two different cache colors avoid cache interference but may not prevent bank interference ."
