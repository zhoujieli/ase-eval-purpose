The 200 Hz sampling rate of the cannula and piezoelectric sensor was one of their limitations for detecting snore events . The different snore sensors do not measure snore events in the same manner Standardization of objective snore measurements is therefore needed .

Knockdown of dOpa1 also impaired axonal transport of mitochondria . But the changed spatial distributions of mitochondria resulted primarily from disruption of inner membrane fusion because knockdown of Milton , a mitochondrial kinesin-1 adapter , caused similar transport velocity impairment but different spatial distributions .

Results The highest-scoring clusters discovered by MDTS were shared with Allegheny Countys Dept . of Human Services and their feedback obtained .

In addition to identifying two well- known , large clusters of overdoses14 deaths in January 2014 and 26 deaths in March-April 2015MDTS was able to provide additional information about each cluster . For example , the first cluster was likely due to fentanyl-laced heroin , while the second was more likely due to fentanyl disguised as heroin ( only 11 victims had heroin in their system ) . Moreover , the second cluster was initially confined to the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport and a typical demographic ( white males ages 20-49 ) , before spreading across the county . Our analysis demonstrated that prospective surveillance using MDTS would have identified the cluster as early as March 29th , enabling targeted prevention efforts . MDTS also discovered a previously unidentified , highly localized cluster of fentanyl-related overdoses affecting an unusual and underserved demographic ( elderly black males near downtown Pittsburgh ) . This cluster occurred in January- February 2015 , and may have been related to the larger cluster of fentanyl-related overdoses that occurred two months later Finally , we identified multiple overdose clusters involving combinations of methadone and Xanax between 2008 and 2012 , and observed dramatic reductions in these clusters corresponding to the passage of the Methadone Death and Incident Review Act ( October 2012 ) , which increased state oversight of methadone clinics and prescribing physicians"
